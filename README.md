A small project which I wrote for a competition I hosted amongst friends.

The aim of the competition was to predict the outcome of a given tournament.
The predictions were split into two phases, and the scoring was totally customisable through the config yaml.

The progress of each player was displayed through a dash webapp. This webapp was linked to livescores.com and would update in realtime whenever a team scores.

The idea was to code this project in the most flexible of manners such that the same code could be reused for future competitions.

On the whole the project was a success, however I have a few suggested improvements for future events:
1. Better structuring/relationship between the Actual Bracket and the Participant's bracket.
1. Predictions entered directly on site, potentially allow ppl to change scores up until date of game.
1. Clearer breakdown of points in results tables.
1. Some kind of odds based scoring system which rewards players for going for upsets.
